# Team Agreement

## Cooperation Plan

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

  - Jeremy - JavaScript, algorithmic thinking, backend
  - Paula - JavaScript, CSS, HTML, availability, positive, curiosity
  - Nick - leadership, team building, digital presentations, content creation, egalitarian, teaching, passionate, CSS, JavaScript
  - Matt - JavaScript/Organization

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

  Each person's strengths can be their primary responsibility in development of certain features.

- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

  On a case-by-case basis, each person who wants to develop in certain areas can pair together with someone more experienced/comfortable on certain features in an effort to develop their skills.

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

  - Team stand up at the beginning of every class
    - What everyone is working on
    - Expected completion
    - Help needed
  
  - Break off into different tables to perform daily work

## Conflict Plan

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

  1. During stand up have a level-setting check-in for any problems that we want to discuss.
  2. Call in Roger for any conflict that isn't deescalating.
  3. If all else fails, "rubber chicken" if things get too hot. It is a phrase or safe word indicating that we should all take 5 minutes to cool off.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

  Go to conflict resolution plan step 1! Everyone is on board to police this behavior in everyone else, and if it's noticed it should be communicated.
  
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

  Give each other grace and consider it an opportunity to solidify your learning by helping someone else learn a concept or feature.

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

  It is the responsibility of each person to communicate when they've taken on more than they can handle, or to ask for help, and it is the responsibility of each person who notices this behavior to bring it up graciously (without accusation).

- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

  Step 2 of the conflict plan!

## Communication Plan

  No one is expected to respond during hours outside of availability

  Daily standup and encouragement

  All of them.
